## About The Project

This project implements a machine learning system for forecasting air quality using Facebook's Prophet library. Developed within a Jupyter Notebook environment, it leverages time-series data to predict future air quality trends, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and decision-making. The notebook demonstrates robust data preprocessing techniques and the application of a powerful forecasting model.

## Features

- **Air Quality Forecasting**: Predicts future air quality trends using the FB Prophet model
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, data cleaning, and transforming date/time formats to prepare data for model input
- **Interactive Development**: All steps from data loading to model training and visualization are contained within an interactive Jupyter Notebook
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Utilizes the capabilities of the FB Prophet model for effective time-series forecasting, accounting for trends and seasonality
- **Python-based Implementation**: Developed entirely in Python, making it accessible and extensible

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and execution
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **fbprophet**: Facebook's open-source library for time series forecasting
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization of trends and forecasts

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project running in your Jupyter environment, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://python.org).

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and to install Jupyter.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

*(Replace `your-username/your-repository-name.git` with your actual GitHub repository link)*

2. Install Jupyter and project dependencies:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You will need to create a requirements.txt file in your project root containing pandas, numpy, fbprophet, matplotlib, seaborn.)*

**Example requirements.txt content:**

```
pandas>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.18.0
fbprophet>=0.7.1
matplotlib>=3.0.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
```

## Usage

To explore and run the air quality forecasting model:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   
   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (where your .ipynb file is located) and run:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter interface.

2. **Open the Notebook:**
   
   From the Jupyter interface, click on your project's .ipynb file (e.g., `air_quality_forecasting.ipynb`).

3. **Run the Cells:**
   
   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load data, preprocess it, train the FB Prophet model, and generate forecasts and visualizations. You can run cells by selecting them and pressing `Shift + Enter`.

**Note:** Ensure your air quality time-series data is located in the expected path relative to the notebook, or update the data loading path within the notebook.
